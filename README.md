# Hi, I'm Donna 

**Postdoctoral Fellow** at [Mila – Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/person/donna-vakalis/), co-supervised by [Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org/) and [David Rolnick](https://davidrolnick.com/).

I develop AI systems to reduce carbon emissions from buildings—which account for ~37% of global CO₂ emissions. My research focuses on **graph-structured world models** and **reinforcement learning** for HVAC control, with an emphasis on building transferable systems that generalize across different building types, layouts, and climates. Previously I studied causal inference and Bayesian methods for decision-making, in the context of indoor air quality and energy use in cities.

## Current Research

My work sits at the intersection of **graph neural networks**, **model-based RL**, and **building physics**:

- **Graph Dreamer** — A world model architecture for variable-size, heterogeneous graph environments that learns structural relationships governing thermal dynamics, enabling zero-shot transfer across buildings with different topologies
- **HVAC-GRACE** — Graph-based Bayesian forecasting and control for buildings
- **HOT Dataset** — A dataset of ~150,000 simulated controllable buildings and gym for transfer learning research

I'm particularly interested in how we can learn *generalizable physics* from simulations

##  Technical Focus

```
Graph Neural Networks  •  Model-Based RL  •  EnergyPlus  •  PyTorch Geometric  •  Spatiotemporal Modeling
```

Most of my recent code lives in private repositories (pre-publication research), but I'm working on releasing components as papers are published.
